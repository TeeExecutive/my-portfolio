## <u>Why'd I do this?</u>

#### ðŸš€ Way More Performance
* Drastically reduced draw calls (1 material!)
* Only 1 texture lookup. All needed textures are **merged**.
* Only 1 SkeletalMeshComponent ðŸ¤¯

#### ðŸ’¸ Saved Development Time
* Code is **shared** between all body parts
* Real-time preview of all modifications!

## <u>What does it look like?</u>
