### Optimizing Gameplay:
This solution is a performance powerhouse. By combining multiple meshes into a single skeletal mesh, I reduced draw calls from a massive 150 across 20 components to just 3. I also optimized textures and shaders, ensuring visuals stay sharp without impacting the game’s performance.

### Streamlined Development:
For me as a developer, it’s a huge time saver. I can tweak designs in real time, use procedural mesh deformation to make gear or outfits fit any character perfectly, and it automatically sorts out mesh layering to dodge visual glitches like z-fighting.

## <u>Conclusion</u>
