#### ðŸš€ Optimizing Gameplay: Unleashing Peak Performance
* **Mesh Merging and Section Reduction:**

>    Merges multiple mesh sections into a single skeletal mesh, reducing draw calls and improving rendering performance.(Only 1 SkeletalMeshComponent ðŸ¤¯)

* **Material and Texture Efficiency:** 

    Optimizes material usage by combining textures and shaders for customized assets.(Drastically reduced draw calls 1 material!)



#### ðŸ’¸ Streamlined Development: Time-Saving Innovations

* **Runtime Customization:**

    Real-time customization in-game with dynamic mesh and material generation.

* **Reduced Z-Fighting and Artifacts:**
