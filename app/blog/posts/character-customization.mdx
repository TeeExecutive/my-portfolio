## <u>Why  this approach?</u>
The Mutable plugin in Unreal Engine is a game changer for building customizable characters, weapons, and vehicles.

### Optimizing Gameplay: Unleashing Peak Performance
It amps up performance by fusing multiple meshes into one skeletal mesh, dropping draw calls from a chaotic 150 across 20 components to a clean 3. Plus, it streamlines materials by blending textures and shaders for buttery-smooth visuals.

### Streamlined Development: Time-Saving Innovations

For devs, it’s a time-saver. You get real time customization, procedural mesh tweaks to make clothes or gear fit any body shape, and it automatically sorts out mesh layering to dodge annoying glitches like Z-Fighting.
