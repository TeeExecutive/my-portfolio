Hey there! I’m super pumped to tell you about my latest project: a character customization system I’ve been working on in Unreal Engine, powered by the Mutable Plugin. Mutable’s honestly a game-changer—it lets me mess with Skeletal Meshes, Materials, and Textures on the fly, so players can tweak their characters however they want without the game grinding to a halt from clunky asset swaps.Hey, want the full scoop? I’m gonna walk you through exactly what I did to pull this off and why I went that route—let’s break it all down together!

## <u> Key Components</u>
>#### Dynamically 
 * swap Skeletal Meshes – Players can modify body types, armor, and accessories without needing seperate models.

>#### Adjust Materials in real time 
* Instead of relying on pre-made material instances, Mutable lets me update colors, patterns, and effects instantly.

>#### Generate Textures at runtime
* This eliminates the need for storing multiple variations, keeping everything optimized.

>#### Optimizing Performance
* Performance improved through strategic draw call reduction and efficient mesh management.
