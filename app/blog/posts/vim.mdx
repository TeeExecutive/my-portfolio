Hey there! I’m super pumped to tell you about my latest project: a character customization system I’ve been working on in Unreal Engine, powered by the Mutable Plugin. Mutable’s honestly a game-changer—it lets me mess with Skeletal Meshes, Materials, and Textures on the fly, so players can tweak their characters however they want without the game grinding to a halt from clunky asset swaps.Hey, want the full scoop? I’m gonna walk you through exactly what I did to pull this off and why I went that route—let’s break it all down together!





 <div style="text-align: center;"><h2><u> Key Components</u><h2></div>

>#### Dynamically 
 * swap Skeletal Meshes – Players can modify body types, armor, and accessories without needing seperate models.

>#### Adjust Materials in real time 
* Instead of relying on pre-made material instances, Mutable lets me update colors, patterns, and effects instantly.

>#### Generate Textures at runtime
* This eliminates the need for storing multiple variations, keeping everything optimized.

>#### Optimizing Performance
* One of my main focuses now is reducing material draw calls. Right now, each piece of armor or clothing has its own material, which isn’t ideal for performance. My plan is to consolidate everything into a single master material, making the system much more efficient while keeping all the customization options intact.
