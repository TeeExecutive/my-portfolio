Hey there! I’m super pumped to tell you about my latest project: a character customization system I’ve been working on in Unreal Engine, powered by the Mutable Plugin. Mutable’s honestly a game-changer—it lets me mess with Skeletal Meshes, Materials, and Textures on the fly, so players can tweak their characters however they want without the game grinding to a halt from clunky asset swaps.Hey, want the full scoop? I’m gonna walk you through exactly what I did to pull this off and why I went that route—let’s break it all down together!

## <u> Key Components</u>
#### Dynamically 
 * swap Skeletal Meshes – Players can modify body types, armor, and accessories without needing seperate models.

#### Adjust Materials in real time 
* Instead of relying on pre-made material instances, Mutable lets me update colors, patterns, and effects instantly.

#### Generate Textures at runtime
* This eliminates the need for storing multiple variations, keeping everything optimized.

#### Optimizing Performance
* Performance improved through strategic draw call reduction and efficient mesh management.

## <u> Step 1 Building the Basics </u>
I created a new Customizable Object, which will serve as the blueprint for building my custom character.

Next, I selected the Base Object node and changed the Object Name value to "Character", since this will represent my main character asset once everything is fully set up.

For the Skeletal Mesh Component node, I assigned a mesh from my character. I made sure that this mesh includes all the skeleton bones required by any additional meshes I plan to add later. To keep everything consistent, I named this node the same as my base Customizable Object — "Character".

Then, I set up a Mesh Section node. I applied a custom material to it, which displays colors on a grid (I'll go into more detail about this later). I connected the LOD 0 - Character - Mesh output pin from the Skeletal Mesh Component node to the input pin of the Mesh Section node.

## <u> Step 2: Define All Character Components </u>
