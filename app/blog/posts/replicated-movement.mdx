## <u>Why  this approach?</u>
I used the Mover Plugin for its top notch performance, delivering silky smooth multiplayer movement with no lag. Its rollback networking predicts player actions, ensuring reliable, stutter-free gameplay even on spotty connections, making the game feel fast, responsive.

### Optimizing Gameplay:
Mover helped me get the best replicated movement I’ve ever seen way better than what I could pull off with CAC. It keeps everything buttery smooth and responsive, even when the network isn’t great. Rollback feels like magic, making every move hit just the way players expect.

### Streamlined Development:
Using Mover really cut down my development time compared to CAC. It automatically handled multiplayer movement replication, so I didn’t have to write a ton of extra code. Plus, it made it super easy to add new movement types, and it’s flexible enough to scale as I add new features.

## <u>Conclusion</u>
Overall, Mover has been a game changer for me. It saved me a ton of development time, made multiplayer movement smoother, and gave me the flexibility to add new features without a huge headache. It’s one of those tools that just works, letting me focus more on building the fun parts of the game and less on fighting with complex systems.
