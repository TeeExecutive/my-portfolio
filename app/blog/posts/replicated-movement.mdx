## <u>Why  this approach?</u>
I chose the Mover Plugin for its exceptional performance, delivering smooth multiplayer movement without lag. Its rollback networking predicts player actions, ensuring reliable, stutter free gameplay even on spotty connections. This makes the game feel fast and responsive, even when network conditions are less than ideal.

### Optimizing Gameplay:
Mover gave me the best replicated movement I’ve experienced, far surpassing what I could achieve with CAC. It keeps everything buttery smooth and responsive, even when the network isn’t stable. The rollback system works like magic, making every movement feel just right, as players expect it to.<br />

### Streamlined Development:
Using Mover really sped up my development time compared to CAC. It automatically handled multiplayer movement replication, saving me from writing extra code. Plus, it made adding new movement types easy and is flexible enough to scale as I add more features.
